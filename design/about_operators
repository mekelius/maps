Some points about operators:
    Any function should be infix without infix markings, i.e. an operator
    There should also be infix marking, is `` too ugly?
    Should operators be scoped, or at least namespaced? We must avoid haskell's Vector.!! weirdness
        Is ad hoc overloading sufficient for this
    Currently operators are global scoped
        There is a bunch of weirdness related to scoped operators, like precedence etc.

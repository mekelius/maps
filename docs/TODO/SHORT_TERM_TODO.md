# Short term TODO

- resolving a name should set the type of the reference, AND check if the declared type matches
    - is this already being done?
        - test this as well maybe?
- figure out partial calls
- rename arg types to param types in FunctionType
- figure out calls to cast functions at runtime
- should there be compile time specialization a'la templates?
    - for example if you return a Number, should there be a specialization that makes it work once

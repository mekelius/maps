# TODO

## Now

- layer 2 type specifier handling
- keep named args in mind
- Type specifiers as let-statement rhs => type decl

### Current goals:
- type specifiers
- print the damn numbers
- add, mult etc.
- some rudimentary casting maybe

## Later
- named args
- parsing needs a lot of work
- traits?
- clean up design files to amore readable state
- print expressions and statements in messages nicely
- pattern matching
- combine asts
- parser gc

## Accumulated tweaks
- name resolution should return false on fail

## Other stuff
- optional unwrapping syntax
- ownership and references
- defining mapping providers
- context syntax
- laziness
- sum types
